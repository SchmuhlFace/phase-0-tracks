10 min plan:

How will I learn about Jquery?

- Read 3Wschool, a resource I ike
- Search websites my previous job made to see Jquery in action
- Watch tutorials

While doing the above, I will also be sure to:

- Take notes in my DBC designated Notebook
- bookmark pages into a special bookmark folder i will name jquery
- share resources via slack and add the jquery channel
- Write a question to fellow classmates to see if they have any resources via slack.

Simultaneously, I will Practice:

-Make a very simple Jquery exercise / site for myself to practice
- If more time is available, do another one!

INGENERAL

- I will take breaks
- I will get up and brink water / visit the bathroom
- I may do breathing exercises ( pranayama) on breaks
