There sure are a lot of different joins! left, right, full outer, inner, to name a few. You can definitely apply different conditions to a join. I found some great resources and have book marked them. I like the visuals of circles too, which helps me see what's being shared (looks like a venn diagram and there are lots of them!).

select fruit.name from fruit where fruit.name not in (select name from storage);

peaches
apples


select names from storage.name right join fruit.name on name.key = name.key where name is null;
Error: RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOINs are not currently supported
