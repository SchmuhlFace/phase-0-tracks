What are some common HTTP status codes?
- 403 Forbidden : access is not permitted
- 404 Not Found : requested resource is no longer available / can't be found


What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

- GET - Requests data from a specified resource : Can be book marked! restrictions on data limit
- POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource : Cannot be book marked; no restrictions on data limit.



Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

- A cookie is small piece of data sent from a website and stored in the user's web browser while the user is browsing ( this cookie crisp sized cookies!). I helps to tell whether a user is logged into an account or not.
