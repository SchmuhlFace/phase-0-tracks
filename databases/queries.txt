Run a SQL query for each of the following:

Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

sqlite> select * from fruit;
1|peach|true|2
2|apple|false|3
3|strawberry|false|1
4|tomato|false|3
5|winter berry|true|4

- Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> update fruit set pit="false" where name="winter berry";
sqlite> select * from fruit ;
1|peach|true|2
2|apple|false|3
3|strawberry|false|1
4|tomato|false|3
5|winter berry|false|4

- Display the information in both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT * FROM fruit, seasons WHERE fruit.season_id = seasons.id;
1|peach|true|2|2|Summer
2|apple|false|3|3|Fall
3|strawberry|false|1|1|Spring
4|tomato|false|3|3|Fall
5|winter berry|false|4|4|Winter

- Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT fruit.name, seasons.name FROM fruit JOIN seasons ON fruit.season_id = seasons.id;
peach|Summer
apple|Fall
strawberry|Spring
tomato|Fall
winter berry|Winter

- Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense). ** I deleted winter berry because it's a fruit i made up to have a fruit in winter ;)

sqlite> DELETE from fruit WHERE name = "winter berry";
sqlite> select * from fruit;
1|peach|true|2
2|apple|false|3
3|strawberry|false|1
4|tomato|false|3

- There are lots of different kinds of joins. What are they? Can you apply different conditions to a join to change what's displayed? Can you bookmark any good diagrams that will help you tell different joins apart in the future?

There sure are a lot of different joins! left, right, full outer, inner, to name a few. You can definitely apply different conditions to a join. I found some great resources and have book marked them. I like the visuals of circles too, which helps me see what's being shared (looks like a venn diagram and there are lots of them!).


- Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands (here they are):
