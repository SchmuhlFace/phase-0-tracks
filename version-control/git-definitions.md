# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control allows us to view the entire history of versions of a file or files. We can roll back to any dot on a time line, and see who made changes. It's a great way to protect software!

* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is the duplication of an object under revision control - such as a source code file or a directory tree - so that modifications can happen in parallel along both branches. We use branches so that multiple programmers can be working on the same program.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? Once you make changes to a file or files, you commit those changes. This makes a point/time stamp on the branch. Each commit message should have a single purpose and should completely implement that purpose. We should commit early and often!

* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict may occurs when your current branch and the branch you want to merge into the current branch diverge. This means have commits in your current branch which are not in the other branch, and vice versa.
