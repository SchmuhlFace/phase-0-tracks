You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

SELECT businesses.name, reviews.comment from businesses join users on businesses.id = users.id join reviews on users.id = reviews.id;

Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Absurdly over priced, even for me
The Beagle Nightclub| Bloody hell, the meat!
Lotus Yoga|fair, as in, food you'd eat at one!


There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT users.first_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses JOIN users ON businesses.id = users.id JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.id;

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

SELECT users.first_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses JOIN users ON businesses.id = users.id JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.id WHERE businesses.name="Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel";
