What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
HTML5 semantic tags describe an element's meaning clearly to both a developer and a browser. I really feel like they are all extremely useful because without them, how would we function?! I see headers as very useful (h1, h2) because it establishes information hierarchy. It also functions as a container for information (allows us to group info thematically), which really appeals to my OCD ;) I also see the navigation tag as important, as it provides a map / overview of the content for site visitors. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

The order the browser uses to display elements on the page is by reading the HTML doc from top to bottom. Sometimes elements that are from other sources can take longer to load, even though the browser still reads the info on the HTML doc from top to bottom. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I learned a snippet is a block of code that can be inserted into my working doc when I ask it to. Tab Trigger allows me to put the keys I want to use in order to trigger the code be put into my doc from the snippet. This can save me a lot of time when I'm working with a lot of code. 


What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

At first I didn't understand that this was a sort of "meta exercise." Typing HTML and tab gives us the basic HTML elements. It's a snippet / short cut! I think the best way for me to understand snippets better is to use them! I love learning new tools and I'm sure DBC will have us use this one. If not, I will try it on my own!
